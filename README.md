# Creature War Project
This project simulates a war between two armies of creatures. In Army One, there are
humans, elves, and aasimars. In Army Two, there are demons like balrogs, cyberdemons,
and tieflings. According to each race's specific max/min strength and hp values, they begin
with a random strength and health and may have special attack abilities. 
Through individual one-on-one fights, one army must defeat the other by killing everyone.
The army with creatures left standing wins.
